#### Section 4.2.8.2: Closed

An Active Account can be set to a status of &#39;Closed&#39; when no longer needed. Before closing, the Account must contain zero Certificates. Thus, the User must Transfer or Retire all Certificates from the Account prior to closing. An Account with a &#39;Closed&#39; status denotes the Account can no longer accept Transfers. This status only applies to Active Accounts.
