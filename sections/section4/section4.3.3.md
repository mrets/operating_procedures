### Section 4.3.3: M-RETS Interaction with State Commissions and Certification of Facilities for State Programs

M-RETS shall be responsible for verifying any information submitted to M-RETS during the Generating Unit Registration Process. Each individual state will be responsible for determining whether a Generating Unit qualifies for a state program. The State Commissions may use the information collected and verified by M-RETS to conduct this determination.

State regulatory commissions have the option of asking M-RETS to send them an electronic version of the registration information for all Generating Units in their jurisdiction or claiming to be eligible for any state programs. If the state commission has exercised this option, M-RETS will send an electronic message to the designated contact at the state commission each time M-RETS registers and verifies such a Generating Unit. The state commissions reserve the right to conduct site visits or request additional information from a Generator to determine whether the facility meets all the requirements.
