#### Section 4.2.8.3: Archived

When a Retirement Account is no longer needed, it can be set to a status of &#39;Archived&#39;. An &#39;Archived&#39; status denotes the Account cannot accept further Retirements. However, Retired Certificates remain in an &#39;Archived&#39; Account. This status only applies to Retirement Accounts.
