## Section 4.2: Accounts

M-RETS supports two Account types; Active Accounts and Retirement Accounts. Users can transfer Certificates to specific Accounts manually or automatically upon upload. Each Account has a unique identification number, similar to a banking system. Users may attach aliases to Accounts for ease of reference (e.g., by state, by product name, etc.).
