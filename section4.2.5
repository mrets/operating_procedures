### Section 4.2.5: Retirement Accounts

An Organization may establish multiple Retirement Accounts at their discretion. A Retirement Account is a repository for M-RETS Certificates that the Organization wants to designate as retired. An Organization may want to retire Certificates for any number of reasons, including, but not limited to demonstrating compliance with a renewable mandate, retiring Certificates on behalf of green power customers, or making claims about the air quality benefits of the renewable Certificates. M-RETS Certificates in a Retirement Account are no longer transferable to another party and serve as an electronic proof of retirement.

Once an M-RETS Certificate is retired to a Retirement Account, those Certificates may not be transferred into any other Account, including another Retirement Account (i.e. if an Organization has multiple Retirement Accounts). The Retirement Account is effectively the last resting place for an M-RETS Certificate.
