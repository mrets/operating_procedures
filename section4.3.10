### Section 4.3.10: Generator Suspension

If M-RETS has cause to suspend the Generating Unit&#39;s participation in M-RETS, Certificate production will cease until M-RETS approves a re-instatement of the Generator. Suspension of a Generator does not affect Certificates previously issued in accordance with the M-RETS Terms of Use and Operating Procedures.
