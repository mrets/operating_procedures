# Section 2: Privacy and Security

Except where explicitly granted within the Operating Procedures, [Terms of Use](https://help.mrets.org/en/articles/1376725-terms-of-use), or by Separate Agreement, M-RETS holds all User information strictly confidential. However, M-RETS provides public reports that include aggregate data available through the public area of the M-RETS website. M-RETS requires comprehensive verification before any information is disclosed, except if the requesting party is identified as a State or Provincial Regulator. More information about confidentiality can be found in the M-RETS [Terms of Use, Section 11](https://help.mrets.org/en/articles/1376725-terms-of-use).

M-RETS requires Users create a secure password with a minimum of 12 characters. M-RETS expressly prohibits the sharing of User credentials. M-RETS requires every person that logs into the System to have their own separate User login credentials. M-RETS tracks the specific activities of each User through the unique User ID and password. Failure to adhere to these security recommendations and the [Terms of Use](https://help.mrets.org/en/articles/1376725-terms-of-use) can lead to loss of access to M-RETS.

M-RETS supports the use of multi-factor authentication (MFA). MFA is currently an opt-in process for Organizations. Our flexible implementation supports receiving the MFA key via SMS, authenticator app, or phone call.
