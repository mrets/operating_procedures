### Section 4.3.4: Multi-Fuel Generators

A multi-fuel Generator is one that can produce energy using more than one fuel type, where the quantity of each of the fuels used is greater than 1% annually on a total heat input basis, excluding fuels used for start-up. A multi-fuel Generator can be a Generating Unit that uses a renewable fuel with a fossil fuel or one that uses multiple types of renewable fuels. Such facilities must register with M-RETS as a multi-fuel Generator. If the Generator Owner or M-RETS cannot measure or calculate the relative quantities of electricity production from each fuel, the Generator is not eligible to register as a multi-fuel Generating Unit in M-RETS.

M-RETS only creates Certificates for renewable fuel types. Each Certificate issued for a multi-fuel Generating Unit will reflect only one fuel source. The total number of Certificates issued for a fuel type in a reporting period will be proportional to the electric output from that fuel type for that reporting period.

The Generator or its owning Organization must maintain supporting documentation related to the derivation of the proportion of electric output per fuel type for each month at the generation facility for a minimum of two years from the date of submission to M-RETS. M-RETS may require copies of such calculations and supporting documentation will be subject to audit by M-RETS, state regulators, or their agents. M-RETS shall treat as Confidential Information all data submitted to or audited by M-RETS subject to the requirements of this paragraph not contained in reports available to the public.
