When a Retirement Account is part of a Program that has closed, it is set to a status of &#39;Frozen&#39;. A &#39;Frozen&#39; status denotes the Account cannot accept further Retirements. However, Retired Certificates remain in an &#39;Frozen&#39; Account. This status only applies to Retirement Accounts.
