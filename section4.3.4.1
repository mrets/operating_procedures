#### Section 4.3.4.1: Allocating Output for Each Fuel Source

For purposes of creating M-RETS Certificates reflecting the fuel source mix of multi-fuel Generating Units, the proportion of Certificates attributable to each fuel source shall be determined consistent with the following rule. For renewable fuels co-fired with fossil fuels or using fossil fuels for startup or supplemental firing: In each month, the Certificates for each fuel in such multi-fuel Generating Units will be created in proportion to the ratio of the net heat content of each fuel consumed to the net heat content of all fuel consumed in that month, adjusted to reflect differential heat rates for different fuels, if applicable.

Upon registration, all multi-fuel Generators must submit to M-RETS a report prepared by a licensed professional engineer containing documentation for measuring and verifying the quantities of each fuel type, the method of determining the net heat content and moisture content of each fuel source, and the heat rate of the Generator, if applicable. M-RETS will share this documentation with state or provincial regulators upon request of the regulator.
