### Section 4.3.5: Multiple Units on a Single Meter

Generating Units register on a meter basis. In the case where there is more than one Generating Unit associated with a single meter, the Generator Owner or Responsible Party can register more than one Generating Units under one registration if, and only if, all the Generating Units have the same essential generation characteristics.

If the Generating Units associated with a single meter do not have the exact same essential generation characteristics, the Generator Owner or Responsible Party has two choices—they can either install a new meter(s) such that all Generating Units associated with a single meter have the same generation characteristics, or they can designate a percentage allocation on an MWh output basis for each different Generating Unit(s) associated with the meter.

_Example: If there are two Generating Units (a biomass direct combustion Generating Unit and a biomass gasification unit and technology type is considered an essential characteristic) associated with one meter, the registrant would indicate that X% of the output as measured at the meter comes from the direct combustion unit and Y% comes from the gasification unit._
