# Account Overview

Accounts are the holding vessels for RECs within the M-RETS System. RECs must always live in one and only one Account.
Account Types

M-RETS supports two Account types; Active Accounts and Retirement Accounts. Users can transfer Certificates to specific accounts manually or automatically upon upload. Each Account has a unique identification number. Users may attach aliases to Accounts for ease of reference (e.g., by state, by product name, etc.). 
                    
An Organization can have one or more Active Account(s).In both cases, multiple accounts may be utilized for the purposes of organizing Certificates for different purposes.  An Active Account is the holding place for M-RETS Certificates that are still active (not retired) in the system. M-RETS Certificates in Active Accounts are liquid and an Organization—depending on the type—may be able to transfer, retire, or export the Certificates. 

An Organization that wishes to make environmental claims may establish Retirement Accounts at their discretion. A Retirement Account is a repository for M-RETS Certificates that the Organization wants to officially make an environmental claim on, thus designating them as retired. M-RETS Certificates in a Retirement Account are no longer transferable to another party and serve as an electronic proof of retirement. No environmental claims can be made on Certificates until they have been retired. An Organization may want to retire certificates for any number of reasons, including, but not limited to demonstrating compliance with a renewable mandate, retiring certificates on behalf of green power customers, or making claims about the air quality benefits of the renewable Certificates. The Retirement Account is effectively the last resting place for an M-RETS Certificate. 

## Account Statuses
    
M-RETS classifies Accounts with the following statuses: Open, Closed, Archived, and Frozen.
                    
An ‘Open’ status denotes the Account is ready to use and Users may Transfer or Retire Certificates to this Account. This status applies to both Active and Retirement Accounts.

An Active Account can be set to a status of ‘Closed’ when no longer needed. Before closing, the Account must contain zero Certificates. Thus, the User must Transfer or Retire all Certificates from the Account prior to closing. An Account with a ‘Closed’ status denotes the Account can no longer accept Transfers. This status only applies to Active Accounts.

When a Retirement Account is no longer needed, it can be set to a status of ‘Archived’. An ‘Archived’ status denotes the Account cannot accept further Retirements. Retired Certificates remain in an ‘Archived’ Account. This status only applies to Retirement Accounts. 
When a Retirement Account is part of a Program that has closed, it is set to a status of ‘Frozen’. A ‘Frozen’ status denotes the Account cannot accept further Retirements. Retired Certificates remain in a ‘Frozen’ Account. This status only applies to Retirement Accounts. See the Programs entity for more information about this feature.
