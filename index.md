# Section 1: Introduction

This document serves as a comprehensive introduction to the Midwest Renewable Energy Tracking System (M-RETS).  M-RETS staff organized this document to help lead Users through registration and use of the System.

M-RETS offers a comprehensive list of training documentation with detailed walkthroughs of features [here](https://help.mrets.org/). M-RETS also offers custom web-based training modules for Organizations. To request a training, please contact [systemadmin@mrets.org](mailto:systemadmin@mrets.org).

M-RETS staff were all involved with the creation and editing of these Operating Procedures. At the time of creation, M-RETS staff consisted of:

Benjamin Gerber, Executive Director

Tanya Gajewska, Chief Administrative Officer

Rosie Hoyem, Program Manager

Sean Darling, Technical Program Coordinator

John Malone, Senior Developer

# Section 2: Privacy and Security

Except where explicitly granted within the Operating Procedures, [Terms of Use](https://help.mrets.org/en/articles/1376725-terms-of-use), or by Separate Agreement, M-RETS holds all User information strictly confidential. However, M-RETS provides public reports that include aggregate data available through the public area of the M-RETS website. M-RETS requires comprehensive verification before any information is disclosed, except if the requesting party is identified as a State or Provincial Regulator. More information about confidentiality can be found in the M-RETS [Terms of Use, Section 11](https://help.mrets.org/en/articles/1376725-terms-of-use).

M-RETS requires Users create a secure password with a minimum of 12 characters. M-RETS expressly prohibits the sharing of User credentials. M-RETS requires every person that logs into the System to have their own separate User login credentials. M-RETS tracks the specific activities of each User through the unique User ID and password. Failure to adhere to these security recommendations and the [Terms of Use](https://help.mrets.org/en/articles/1376725-terms-of-use) can lead to loss of access to M-RETS.

# Section 3: Establishing an M-RETS Organization

Participation in M-RETS is voluntary, though some states or provinces may require participation in M-RETS for purposes of regulatory program compliance. Any party that registers with M-RETS and pays the applicable fees may establish an Organization in the System.

There is no limit to the number of separate Organizations a company or individual may establish. Registrants will provide basic Organization registration information, such as username, address, contact info, etc. to M-RETS through a secure webpage on M-RETS. The registrant must pay all required fees specific to the Organization type subject to the M-RETS [Terms of Use](https://help.mrets.org/en/articles/1376725-terms-of-use). An Organization in M-RETS will remain active until Inactivated (_See_Section 3.2: Inactivating an Organization).

M-RETS will check all Organization registration or modified existing Organization entries for completeness. An error message will flag mandatory fields not completed by the registrant.

Each Organization shall pay an annual Subscription Fee. A renewal fee will be due in the month of registration of each subsequent calendar year. The Subscription Fee will be based upon the type of Organization subscribed. Below is a visual representation of the subscription types with more detailed information. Please note that for billing purposes M-RETS will use the prices listed on the website.

If a subscriber fails to pay their annual Subscription Fee within ninety-days (90) of issuance, M-RETS shall close the Organizations access to the System. A User that wishes to reactivate an Organization that is closed due to failure to pay shall be required to pay the full annual Subscription Fee as well as an additional reactivation fee equal to 65% of the current Subscription Fee applicable to the closed Organization.

- **Micro-Generator Project Subscription: $50/year**
  - This type of Organization can register a total of up to 100 kW in nameplate capacity of renewable Generators and have Certificates issued to it for its Generators. A Micro-Generator Project can hold, transfer (only outgoing transfers), withdraw and retire Certificates. A Micro-Generator Project cannot receive transfers from other parties.

- **Small Generator Project Subscription: $125/year**
  - This type of Organization can register a total of up to 1.5 MW in total nameplate capacity of renewable Generators and have Certificates issued to it for its Generators. A Small Generator Project can hold, transfer (only outgoing transfers), withdraw and retire Certificates. A Small Generator Project cannot receive transfers from other parties.

- **Project Subscription: $550/year**
  - This type of Organization can register one or more renewable Generators and have Certificates issued to it for its Generators. A Project can hold, transfer (only outgoing transfers), withdraw, and retire Certificates. This type of Organization cannot receive transfers from other parties.

- **General Subscription: $2,200/year**
  - This type of Organization can hold, transfer (outgoing and incoming), and retire Certificates as well as register and maintain Generators and have Certificates issued to it for its Generators. This Organization type is the only type that can retire Certificates for compliance with any of the State RPS programs utilizing MRETS.

- **Retail Purchaser Subscription: $1,100/year**
  - This type of Organization is for retail purchasers of Certificates. A Retail Purchaser can hold, accept incoming transfers, and retire Certificates. They can also register and maintain Generators that are under 1 MW in capacity and have Certificates issued in their Organization. Retail Purchasers cannot make outgoing transfers.

- **Qualified Reporting Entity (QRE): No Fee**
  - Qualified Reporting Entity is the control area operator, interconnecting utility, scheduling coordinator, or an independent third-party meter reader and is not affiliated with the owner of the Generator for which the entity is reporting; or the control area operator or interconnecting utility and that is affiliated with the Generator owner, but having sufficient segregation of duties such that the person performing the QRE duties does not have access to transfer or retire Certificates created for that Generator. A QRE must enter into an agreement with M-RETS describing the terms and conditions under which the QRE agrees to conduct business with M-RETS and must report data in accordance with the standards set forth in these Operating Procedures.

- **Program Administrator/Government Regulator: No Fee**
  - State regulators, including but not limited to public utility commission and public service commission staff and voluntary market program administrators (e.g. Green-e) may be granted a Program Administrator/Government Regulator Organization. To find out if an Organization qualifies please contact M-RETS at [systemadmin@mrets.org](mailto:systemadmin@mrets.org).

## Section 3.2: Inactivating an Organization

A User with the appropriate permissions may begin the Organization Inactivation procedure by notifying M-RETS in writing from the email associated with a User that has the proper permission level.  The User shall furnish the data that M-RETS should place the Organization into Inactive status. Any Generator assigned to the Organization will become Inactive and may not produce any further Certificates. Moreover, once Inactive Users from the Organization may not access any remaining Certificates or pending Transactions.

## Section 4.1: Users

Users may create additional Users within their Organization by accessing the Organization information tab within the System.

M-RETS expressly prohibits the sharing of User credentials. M-RETS requires every person that logs into the System to have their own separate User login credentials. M-RETS tracks the specific activities of each User through the unique User ID and password.

More information about confidentiality can be found in the [M-RETS Terms of Use.](https://help.mrets.org/en/articles/1376725-terms-of-use)

### Section 4.1.1: User Permissions

Every User in M-RETS has customizable permissions. Users can be set as Manage, Read Only, or No Access. Only a User with Manage permissions for the Organization can change permissions. The abilities of each level are as follows:

- Manage: Ability to view and edit the topic
- Read Only: Ability to solely view the topic
- No Access: Inability to view or edit the topic

#### Section 4.1.1.1: Organization Permission

In M-RETS, &#39;Organization&#39; refers to the Organization Information, Billing Contact Information, and User List.

#### Section 4.1.1.2: Transactions Permission

In M-RETS, &#39;Transactions&#39; refers to incoming and outgoing transfers of Certificates. A User with &#39;Manage&#39; permissions will be able to transfer as well as accept incoming transfers of Certificates.

#### Section 4.1.1.3: Generators Permission

In M-RETS, &#39;Generators&#39; refers to Projects and Generators. A User with &#39;Manage&#39; permission will be able to create new Generators and edit current Generators.

#### Section 4.1.1.4: Billing Permission

In M-RETS, &#39;Billing&#39; refers to the invoicing System. A User with &#39;Manage&#39; permissions will be able to view and save invoice details.

#### Section 4.1.1.5: API Permission

In M-RETS, &#39;API&#39; refers to the application programming interface. Any User that intends to connect and use our API will need Manage permissions.

#### Section 4.1.1.6: Generation Permission

In M-RETS, &#39;Generation&#39; refers to the uploading and issuance of Certificates. A User with &#39;Manage&#39; permissions will be able to upload MWh information for issuance.

### Section 4.1.2: Notification Settings

M-RETS allows Users to opt into email notifications when certain changes occur to their Organization. By default, M-RETS disables email notifications. M-RETS encourages Users to enable email notifications in their settings. An informational walk-through on notification settings is on the [integrated help system.](https://help.mrets.org/en/articles/2034693-email-notifications)

There are three notification settings:

1. Transfers
2. Issuances
3. Retirements

### Section 4.1.3: Notification Categories

#### Section 4.1.3.1: Transfers

 This setting automatically emails Users upon initiation and completion of a transfer.

Example:

#### Section 4.1.3.2: Issuance

This setting emails Users upon generation data upload.

Example:

#### Section 4.1.3.3: Retirements

This setting emails Users when Certificates are retired.

Example:

### Section 4.1.4: Inactivating Users

It is the Organization&#39;s responsibility to make sure the User list is current. This includes inactivating Users when they leave the company or no longer require access. This also includes adding Users to replace Users that have left the Organization. Failure to do this can lead to significant delays in accessing an Organization.

In order to reinstate access to M-RETS, the Organization shall be required to present specific evidence that the managing employee is no longer with the Organization and the Organization maintains no other way to reset the password (e.g. accessing the former employee&#39;s email and utilizing the password reset function). M-RETS reserves the right to set the level of specific evidence, including but not limited to affidavits from executives maintaining the circumstances surrounding the departure of the employee and failure to transfer access to another User within the Organization.

Organizations may inactivate a User at any time for any reason. M-RETS may inactivate a User for failure to adhere to the Operating Procedures or Terms of Use.

Section 4.2: Accounts
---------------------

M-RETS supports two Account types; Active Accounts and Retirement
Accounts. Users can transfer Certificates to specific Accounts manually
or automatically upon upload. Each Account has a unique identification
number, similar to a banking system. Users may attach aliases to
Accounts for ease of reference (e.g., by state, by product name, etc.).

### Section 4.2.1: Active Accounts

An Organization can have one or more Active Account(s). An Active
Account is the holding place for all active M-RETS Certificates. The
Active Account is like a cash checking Account. M-RETS Certificates in
Active Accounts are liquid and an Organization---depending on the
type---may be able to transfer, retire, or export the Certificates.

If the Account has a Generating Unit(s) associated with it, the Active
Account will be the first point of deposit for any M-RETS Certificates
created that are associated with the Generating Unit(s) ID number.

### Section 4.2.2: Deposits to the Active Account

There are four ways that M-RETS Certificates are deposited in an Active
Account.

1.  The Organization can transfer M-RETS Certificates into their Active
    Account from another of the Organization's Active Accounts.

2.  The Organization can accept a transfer of Certificates from another
    M-RETS Organization.

3.  The Certificates can be deposited into the Account by M-RETS based
    on verified generation data from a Generating Unit associated with
    the Active Account or through an adjustment approved by M-RETS in
    accordance with the Operating Procedures.

4.  The Certificates can be deposited by M-RETS through the import
    process. If the Organization has more than one Active Account, the
    Organization can specify in each case the Active Account in which
    they want the Certificates deposited.

### Section 4.2.3: Transfers from the Active Account

There are four ways to withdraw or remove M-RETS Certificates from an
Active Account:

1.  Transfer the M-RETS Certificates to another of one's own Accounts
    (e.g. retirement), or

2.  Transfer the M-RETS Certificates to multiple of one's own Accounts,
    or

3.  Transfer the M-RETS Certificates to the Active Account of another
    M-RETS Organization, or

4.  Export the M-RETS Certificates out of M-RETS to another compatible
    tracking system.

### Section 4.2.4: Functionality of an Active Account

In addition to being able to deposit and withdraw M-RETS Certificates
from the Active Account, Organizations may view and sort their
Certificates by a number of Certificate fields, generate reports about
their Account, create additional Active Accounts, and transfer active
M-RETS Certificates between Active Accounts.

### Section 4.2.5: Retirement Accounts

An Organization may establish multiple Retirement Accounts at their
discretion. A Retirement Account is a repository for M-RETS Certificates
that the Organization wants to designate as retired. An Organization may
want to retire Certificates for any number of reasons, including, but
not limited to demonstrating compliance with a renewable mandate,
retiring Certificates on behalf of green power customers, or making
claims about the air quality benefits of the renewable Certificates.
M-RETS Certificates in a Retirement Account are no longer transferable
to another party and serve as an electronic proof of retirement.

Once an M-RETS Certificate is retired to a Retirement Account, those
Certificates may not be transferred into any other Account, including
another Retirement Account (i.e. if an Organization has multiple
Retirement Accounts). The Retirement Account is effectively the last
resting place for an M-RETS Certificate.

### Section 4.2.6: Deposits to the Retirement Account

*See* Section 4.5.3: Retirement of Certificates

### Section 4.2.7: Functionality of the Retirement Account

Retirement Accounts exist to hold Certificates permanently removed from
circulation and serve as proof that the corresponding Certificates are
subject to a voluntary or compliance claim or otherwise removed from
circulation. Once an Organization completes the retirement, they cannot
later change the retirement reason. This prevents the Certificate from
being subject to a double claim. If, however, the Organization contacts
M-RETS in writing within 24-hours from the time the Organization
indicated the reason for retirement, M-RETS may grant a variance.

M-RETS will grant a variance within the 24-hour notice period when there
is no likelihood a Certificate was claimed to be retired for multiple
reasons and M-RETS does not suspect any nefarious intent or impropriety.
If M-RETS believes there is any chance of double counting, they shall
deny the request for a variance.

If an Organization notices an error in the selected retirement reason
outside the 24-hour window, the Organization may contact M-RETS
(<systemadmin@mrets.org>) in writing and ask that M-RETS grant [a
variance](https://www.mrets.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Variance-Request-Form.docx).[^1]
M-RETS shall review all requests made outside of the 24-hour window and
may grant a variance if they determine that the request is made in good
faith and: that the Organization submitted their request for a variance
in writing within a reasonable amount of time after discovering the
error, that there is a legitimate reason for the change, and that there
is no likelihood a Certificate was claimed to be retired for multiple
reasons. M-RETS may submit the variance request---or send an email
outlining the circumstances---to a state or provincial regulator should
there be concern compliance with the variance request could result in
potential double counting.

### 

### Section 4.2.8: Account Status

M-RETS classifies Accounts with the following statuses: Open, Closed,
Archived, and Frozen.

#### Section 4.2.8.1: Open

An 'Open' status denotes the Account is ready to use and Users may
Transfer or Retire Certificates to this Account. This status applies to
both Active and Retirement Accounts.

#### 

#### Section 4.2.8.2: Closed

An Active Account can be set to a status of 'Closed' when no longer
needed. Before closing, the Account must contain zero Certificates.
Thus, the User must Transfer or Retire all Certificates from the Account
prior to closing. An Account with a 'Closed' status denotes the Account
can no longer accept Transfers. This status only applies to Active
Accounts.

#### Section 4.2.8.3: Archived

When a Retirement Account is no longer needed, it can be set to a status
of 'Archived'. An 'Archived' status denotes the Account cannot accept
further Retirements. However, Retired Certificates remain in an
'Archived' Account. This status only applies to Retirement Accounts.

#### Section 4.2.8.4: Frozen

When a Retirement Account is part of a Program that has closed, it is
set to a status of 'Frozen'. A 'Frozen' status denotes the Account
cannot accept further Retirements. However, Retired Certificates remain
in an 'Frozen' Account. This status only applies to Retirement Accounts.

Section 4.3: Generators
-----------------------

M-RETS defines renewable generation as energy generated by a facility
that any state, province, or territory participating in M-RETS considers
renewable by law or policy. M-RETS issues one electronic Certificate for
each MWh of renewable energy produced by Generators registered and
approved in M-RETS. To ensure that double-counting does not occur,
Generators participating in M-RETS must report 100% of their generation
output in M-RETS. M-RETS maintains a list of state definitions of
renewable energy located in the M-RETS compliance footprint
[here](https://www.mrets.org/resources/statutes/).

Any Generator that delivers energy into North America may register in
M-RETS. Other states, provinces, territories, countries or Generators
outside of North America may request to use M-RETS subject to the
approval of the M-RETS Board. In addition, M-RETS will track other
generation forms (e.g. nuclear generation) or other environmental
attributes. Requests to add a generator outside North America or to
track other generation forms should be made in writing to the M-RETS
System Administrator (<systemadmin@mrets.org>) and M-RETS leadership
listed [here](https://www.mrets.org/m-rets-staff/).

M-RETS may issue Certificates for any energy production serving a load
that the grid would otherwise serve if not for the Generator. M-RETS
will not create Certificates for generation supplying station
service/parasitic load.

For customer-sited distributed Generators, the original data source for
reporting total energy production must be from metering at the AC output
of an inverter, adjusted to reflect the energy delivered into either the
transmission or distribution grid. In the absence of a meter measuring
production as described above (i.e. if there is no meter at the
inverter), the original data source for reporting total energy
production must be from metering placed to measure only the hourly
positive generation flowing to the distribution system, adjusted to
reflect the energy delivered into either the transmission or
distribution grid. Test energy is not treated differently and must also
be delivered to the transmission or distribution grid.

M-RETS defines a Generator as an electric generating facility consisting
of one or more Generating Units with the same essential generation
characteristics with a single meter that measures the output.

### Section 4.3.1: Registration of a Generator

All Generator Owners must first establish an Organization subscription
and then register the Generating Unit(s) with M-RETS. As part of the
Generator Registration Agreement, the User must attest that this Unit is
not registered in any other Registry. Generating Unit(s) that are
jointly owned must privately appoint a single Organization where the
Generator will reside.

To register the Generating Unit(s), the owner of the Generating Unit or
the Responsible Party must submit to M-RETS the following:

1.  A completed on-line Generator registration form containing
    information related to the characteristics of the Generating Unit
    and associated meter.

2.  If applicable: A completed [Schedule A from the M-RETS Terms of Use
    outlining the Generator Owner's Designation of Responsible
    Party](https://www.mrets.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/MRETS-Schedule-A-Modified-12-28-2017.pdf).

3.  Any documentation requested by M-RETS to verify the registration
    information

    a.  It is helpful for Generators to include a Generator
        interconnection agreement that helps support the registration
        information. *See* Acceptable Documentation in Appendix A:
        Generator Static Data Fields.

    b.  Providing a Generators EIA Entity ID which is an official,
        unique identification numbers assigned by EIA can expedite the
        approval process. The EIA Entity ID is required for all
        Generators over 1 MW in the United States and may be found by
        accessing the report
        [here](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia860M/).

4.  If this Generator will use MISO as the reporting entity, please fill
    out and upload [this
    form](https://www.mrets.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/M-RETS-MISO-DATA-RELEASE-2-9-2018213.pdf)
    in the Generator documents. It is important that the form reflects
    the correct MISO node.

The Generator registration process will include both mandatory and
optional data entry and M-RETS shall verify all data prior to making a
Generator Active.

*NOTE: Registration with M-RETS does not imply or confer acceptance into
or eligibility for any state's Renewable Portfolio Standard program.*

*A Visual Guide to the Generator Registration Process*

#### Section 4.3.1.1: Static Data in M-RETS

Static data fields describe the physical attributes of the Generating
Unit. Users provide this data to M-RETS during the Generator
registration process, and the subsequent update processes described
below.

M-RETS shall verify all static data before including it in the System.
Appendix A: Generator Static Data Fields lists the method of
verification for each data field. In addition, M-RETS may conduct site
visits to further verify the information as needed.

### 

### Section 4.3.2: Verification of Static Data Submitted During Generator Registration

Upon completion of the Generator registration process, the User
represents and warrants to M-RETS that all information for this
Generator shall be true, complete, and correct to the best of its
knowledge, information, and belief. Any changes after submission may
result in a delay in the approval process. The Generator approval
process begins once the Generator is submitted from a draft status.

In the event data submitted is inaccurate or if there is a discrepancy
between the information submitted during the on-line registration
process and the materials provided to verify the information, M-RETS
will notify the registrant of the issue. A process of either correcting
the data in the online registration form, withdrawing the registration,
or providing proof that the information on the registration form is
correct will ensue between M-RETS and the registrant until M-RETS is
satisfied that the information provided meets M-RETS approval standards.

### Section 4.3.3: M-RETS Interaction with State Commissions and Certification of Facilities for State Programs

M-RETS shall be responsible for verifying any information submitted to
M-RETS during the Generating Unit Registration Process. Each individual
state will be responsible for determining whether a Generating Unit
qualifies for a state program. The State Commissions may use the
information collected and verified by M-RETS to conduct this
determination.

State regulatory commissions have the option of asking M-RETS to send
them an electronic version of the registration information for all
Generating Units in their jurisdiction or claiming to be eligible for
any state programs. If the state commission has exercised this option,
M-RETS will send an electronic message to the designated contact at the
state commission each time M-RETS registers and verifies such a
Generating Unit. The state commissions reserve the right to conduct site
visits or request additional information from a Generator to determine
whether the facility meets all the requirements.

### Section 4.3.4: Multi-Fuel Generators

A multi-fuel Generator is one that can produce energy using more than
one fuel type, where the quantity of each of the fuels used is greater
than 1% annually on a total heat input basis, excluding fuels used for
start-up. A multi-fuel Generator can be a Generating Unit that uses a
renewable fuel with a fossil fuel or one that uses multiple types of
renewable fuels. Such facilities must register with M-RETS as a
multi-fuel Generator. If the Generator Owner or M-RETS cannot measure or
calculate the relative quantities of electricity production from each
fuel, the Generator is not eligible to register as a multi-fuel
Generating Unit in M-RETS.

M-RETS only creates Certificates for renewable fuel types. Each
Certificate issued for a multi-fuel Generating Unit will reflect only
one fuel source. The total number of Certificates issued for a fuel type
in a reporting period will be proportional to the electric output from
that fuel type for that reporting period.

The Generator or its owning Organization must maintain supporting
documentation related to the derivation of the proportion of electric
output per fuel type for each month at the generation facility for a
minimum of two years from the date of submission to M-RETS. M-RETS may
require copies of such calculations and supporting documentation will be
subject to audit by M-RETS, state regulators, or their agents. M-RETS
shall treat as Confidential Information all data submitted to or audited
by M-RETS subject to the requirements of this paragraph not contained in
reports available to the public.

#### 

#### Section 4.3.4.1: Allocating Output for Each Fuel Source

For purposes of creating M-RETS Certificates reflecting the fuel source
mix of multi-fuel Generating Units, the proportion of Certificates
attributable to each fuel source shall be determined consistent with the
following rule. For renewable fuels co-fired with fossil fuels or using
fossil fuels for startup or supplemental firing: In each month, the
Certificates for each fuel in such multi-fuel Generating Units will be
created in proportion to the ratio of the net heat content of each fuel
consumed to the net heat content of all fuel consumed in that month,
adjusted to reflect differential heat rates for different fuels, if
applicable.

Upon registration, all multi-fuel Generators must submit to M-RETS a
report prepared by a licensed professional engineer containing
documentation for measuring and verifying the quantities of each fuel
type, the method of determining the net heat content and moisture
content of each fuel source, and the heat rate of the Generator, if
applicable. M-RETS will share this documentation with state or
provincial regulators upon request of the regulator.

### Section 4.3.5: Multiple Units on a Single Meter

Generating Units register on a meter basis. In the case where there is
more than one Generating Unit associated with a single meter, the
Generator Owner or Responsible Party can register more than one
Generating Units under one registration if, and only if, all the
Generating Units have the same essential generation characteristics.

If the Generating Units associated with a single meter do not have the
exact same essential generation characteristics, the Generator Owner or
Responsible Party has two choices---they can either install a new
meter(s) such that all Generating Units associated with a single meter
have the same generation characteristics, or they can designate a
percentage allocation on an MWh output basis for each different
Generating Unit(s) associated with the meter.

> *Example: If there are two Generating Units (a biomass direct
> combustion Generating Unit and a biomass gasification unit and
> technology type is considered an essential characteristic) associated
> with one meter, the registrant would indicate that X% of the output as
> measured at the meter comes from the direct combustion unit and Y%
> comes from the gasification unit.*

### Section 4.3.6: Distributed Generation Aggregation

For small (\<1 MW) Generating Units, M-RETS will allow aggregation
("Distributed Generation Aggregation") of Units not metered together and
which do not share the same location, but which are located within the
same state or province, and which otherwise share the same essential
generation characteristics identified in Appendix B: Fuel Type & Fuel
Source.

Aggregated Generators must meet the following criteria:

a.  The M-RETS State/Province programs allows for aggregation if an
    eligibility is sought; and

b.  The Aggregated Units do not exceed a total nameplate capacity of 1
    MW.

M-RETS may require documentation to verify each Aggregated Unit and
generation data including proof of the right to registration and proof
that each unit is within acceptable proximity to the other units.

### Section 4.3.7: Annual Review of Generators

M-RETS requires Users to update/review Generators once a year during the
month of January to ensure correct information. M-RETS will email Users
with the requisite permissions as well as prompt them within the System
to complete the review.

It is the User's requirement to confirm that they represent and warrant
to M-RETS that all information for their Generator shall be true,
complete, and correct to the best of their knowledge, information, and
belief.

M-RETS requires that Organizations review and accept all Generator data
by January 31^st^. Failure to complete the annual review for each
Generator in an Organization by January 31^st^ each year will result in
the loss of access to the Organization until a User with proper
permissions reviews and confirms all of the data for every Generator in
the Organization.

### Section 4.3.8: Changes to Static Data

In addition to the annual update, Users must notify M-RETS of the
following that have the effect of changing static data tracked by M-RETS
within 30 calendar days of the effective date and/or knowledge of the
change:

a.  A change in fuel type at a Generating Unit, and the date on which
    the change occurred.

b.  A change in Generating Unit ownership (*See* Section 4.3.12:
    Changing the Organization to which the Generator is Associated).

c.  A change to Generator eligibility for any programs or certification
    tracked by M-RETS. Before M-RETS adds an eligibility to a Generator,
    M-RETS will verify the Generator meets the states eligibility
    requirements. In the case where a state requires preapproval, M-RETS
    will require the appropriate documentation and reserves the right to
    verify this information with the appropriate state, province or
    independent certifier. A User may remove an eligibility at any time.

d.  A change to any of the "essential generating characteristics".

M-RETS can remove Generators for cause, including willful
misrepresentation of static data. M-RETS may rely on the M-RETS dispute
resolution process (*See* [M-RETS Terms of
Use](https://help.mrets.org/en/articles/1376725-terms-of-use)) to
address such situations, and M-RETS will accept no liability for
Generator misrepresentations. M-RETS reserves the right to take
appropriate action in consultation with the M-RETS Board to respond to
willful misrepresentation of static data, including but not limited to
withholding issuing Certificates, Inactivating an Organization
associated with a particular Generating Unit, or withholding
participation in M-RETS for Generating Units that have willfully
misrepresented static data.

### Section 4.3.9: Generator Inactivation

To ensure data integrity, unused or retired Generators are set to an
'Inactive' status. Only M-RETS can Inactivate a Generator. Setting a
Generator to Inactive prevents any subsequent generation uploads and
Certificate creation by the Generator. Inactivating a Generator does not
affect previously issued Certificates.

### Section 4.3.10: Generator Suspension

If M-RETS has cause to suspend the Generating Unit's participation in
M-RETS, Certificate production will cease until M-RETS approves a
re-instatement of the Generator. Suspension of a Generator does not
affect Certificates previously issued in accordance with the M-RETS
Terms of Use and Operating Procedures.

### Section 4.3.11: Generator Termination

If M-RETS has cause to permanently terminate the Generating Unit's
participation in M-RETS, M-RETS will cease any further production of
Certificates, and the Generator will be inaccessible. Termination of a
Generator does not affect Certificates previously issued in accordance
with the M-RETS Terms of Use and Operating Procedures.

### Section 4.3.12: Changing the Organization to which the Generator is Associated

If the Generator Owner or Responsible Party ("Transferor") wants to
change the Organization to which a Generating Unit is associated, they
can do so by requesting the change from M-RETS in writing or via email.

The Transferor must confirm the following:

a.  The Organization Name and Organization I.D. of the Transferor.

b.  The Generator Name and M-RETS I.D.

c.  The effective date of the change and the last vintage that should be
    issued to the Transferor.

> The Transferee must confirm the following:

a.  The Organization Name and Organization I.D.

b.  The Generator Name and M-RETS I.D.

c.  The Account Name and Account I.D. to which the Generator will
    initially issue Certificates upon competition of the change.

d.  The effective date of the change and the first vintage that should
    be issued to the Transferee.

e.  Any changes to the static Generator data (e.g. new Reporting Entity,
    Eligibilities).

Certificates from generation that occurred up to the day the
Organization change takes effect will be issued into the Organization
that the Generating Unit was associated with at the time the generation
occurred.

> *For example, if the Generator owner changes the Organization to which
> a given Generating Unit is associated with from Organization A to
> Organization B, and the change is effective on March 1, then the
> Certificates from generation that occurred prior to March 1, will be
> deposited into Organization A (even though the date of Certificate
> deposit will be after March 1, because of the lag time between
> generation occurrence and Certificate issuance.)*

There cannot be any lapse in time where the Generator is not associated
with an M-RETS Organization. If there is a period when the Generator is
not associated with an M-RETS Organization, M-RETS will treat this as an
Inactivation/Reactivation of the Generator instead of a change of
Organization.

Any fractional remainder MWhs (i.e. any kWh) will transfer to the new
owner of the Generator.

### Section 4.3.13: Assignment of Rights of Registration -- Designation of Responsible Party

The owner of a Generating Unit or Responsible Party may assign the right
to register the Generating Unit(s) in M-RETS to an M-RETS Organization
for the purposes of allowing that party the ability to control and
manage the disposition of any M-RETS Certificates resulting from the
operation of the Generating Unit(s). This assignment of registration
rights will give the designated Organization full and sole management
and authority over the transactions and activities related to the
Generating Unit within M-RETS. For the purposes of M-RETS, this party is
the Responsible Party for that Generating Unit.

M-RETS will require both parties to confirm an assignment of
registration rights and the date the assignment will be effective, and
the termination date if applicable.

### Section 4.3.14: Termination of Rights of Registration

The Generator Owner or the Responsible Party may terminate the Rights of
Registration subject to confirmation by M-RETS that both the Generator
Owner and Responsible Party agree to the termination. The User will file
the Generating Unit Termination form with M-RETS. The form specifies who
the new Responsible Party with the Rights of Registration is and the
date the change in registration will occur. Termination of Rights of
Registration has the effect of deregistering the Generating Unit from
M-RETS. Thus, no new Certificates will be issued from that generating
upon the effective date of the termination. *See* Section 4.3.12:
Changing the Organization to which the Generator is Associated for
additional information.

### Section 4.3.15: Changing Rights of Registration

When changing the Rights of Registration, the disposition of the
Certificates from that Generating Unit will follow the rules in Section
4.3.13: Assignment of Rights of Registration -- Designation of
Responsible Party. This function applies equally to the Generator Owner
or to a Responsible Party, meaning that the Responsible Party can change
the Rights of Registration to another party.

When changing the Rights of Registration, M-RETS will confirm that both
parties (the Generator Owner or current Responsible Party and the new
Responsible Party) agree to the change. If the Generator Owner or
Responsible Party wants to change the Organization to which a Generating
Unit is associated, they can do so by filing the Generating Unit
Transfer Form with M-RETS. The form specifies who the new Responsible
Party with the Rights of Registration is, and the date the change in
registration will occur. There cannot be any lapse in time where the
Generating Unit is not associated with an M-RETS Organization. If there
is a period when the Generating Unit is not associated with an M-RETS
Organization, M-RETS will treat this as a deregistration/re-registration
of the Generating Unit.

In addition, the User must review---and update if necessary---the basic
Generator Registration data when the Right of Registration is changed
from one party to another.

Section 4.4: Generation
-----------------------

Any User with Generation Upload permissions can submit MWh data into
M-RETS. Each time M-RETS receives generation data for a Generator, the
date and quantity of MWhs is posted to the Generation Log. Any
fractional remainders (i.e. kWh) will not issue Certificates but will
roll over to the next month of generation. Once uploaded, data will be
labeled with one of the following:

-   **Accepted**: Applies to all generation less than 1 MWh reported to
    M-RETS. The System will add this data to the subsequent month of
    generation for issuance.

-   **Issued**: Applies to all generation 1 MWh or greater and indicates
    the Certificates are now active.

-   **Pending**: Generation that fails feasibility and therefore needs
    M-RETS approval; or generation waiting to receive a 'fuel type'
    allocation from a multi-fuel Generator. Pending Generation is not
    issued and therefore not represented by Active Certificates.

### 

### Section 4.4.1: Acceptable Format

A QRE or User must upload generation through the M-RETS portal. The data
must be in a .csv file format. Excel or Notepad can create a CSV file.
Programs (e.g. Microsoft Excel) that add formatting may reformat date
fields which will result in errors when loading the file. The data shall
be in ASCII Text with data fields delimited by commas (Comma-Separated
Value -- CSV format). M-RETS supports two types of reporting. Users may
upload all their generation for the whole month or in partial months as
long as a whole month is uploaded.

#### Monthly Generation Data Field Requirements

![A close up of a logo Description automatically
generated](media/image2.png){width="3.6461537620297464in"
height="0.7364654418197726in"}

1.  Generator ID: The M-RETS ID. Use just the number (e.g. M805 should
    be listed as 805).

2.  Reporting Unit ID: The Reporting Unit ID.

3.  Vintage: Month and year of generation, formatted at MM/YYYY for any
    month in the current Reporting Period. This must be 7 characters
    long or the upload will fail.

4.  Start Date of the Month: Begin month-day-year of generation output
    period formatted as MM/DD/YYYY. This must be 10 characters long or
    the upload will fail.

5.  End Date of the Month: End month-day-year of generation output
    period formatted as MM/DD/YYYY. This must be 10 characters long or
    the upload will fail.

6.  Total MWh: Total MWhs for the Reporting Month

#### Hourly Generation Data Field Requirements

![A close up of text on a white background Description automatically
generated](media/image3.png){width="2.8396620734908136in"
height="3.2447648731408574in"}

1.  Generator ID: The M-RETS ID. Use just the number (e.g. M805 should
    be listed as 805).

2.  Reporting Unit ID: The Reporting Unit ID.

3.  Date of Generation: The date the generation occurred formatted as
    MM/DD/YYYY.

4.  Total MWH: Total MWHs for the Reporting Month.

5.  Hour of Generation (1-24). All hours for the total reporting period
    must Accounted for or the file will be rejected.

6.  Total kWh for that specific hour.

Monthly generation will be uploaded in MWH. Hourly/minute data must be
uploaded in kWh.

-   Uploading by hour or minute is optional.

-   RECs are still created, retired, and transferred in MWH. Generation
    by hour or minute provide more granularity in the data associated
    with each REC batch. 

-   While generation by hour or minute increments is uploaded in kWh,
    Certificates are still only created in MWh.

> MISO also provides data with On Peak/Off Peak designation. This data
> is for informational purposes only, however, it will give Generator
> owners more information about their production. 

-   MISO defines On Peak and Off Peak in their [[FERC approved
    Tariff]{.underline} ](https://mrets.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=3881192bd43372fa77b8a86ab&id=51e3db43e1&e=cfa8a6389f)as: 

    -   Off-Peak: All periods of time not classified as On Peak.

    -   On Peak: Period of time between Hour-ending 0700 EST through and
        including Hour-ending 2200 Hours EST Monday through Friday
        excepting New Year's, Memorial Day, Fourth of July, Labor Day,
        Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day or if the holiday occurs on
        a Sunday, the Monday immediately following the holiday.

### Section 4.4.2: Uploading Time Restrictions

To encourage timely reporting, M-RETS enabled automatic validations to generation uploads. For small Generators (1 to 150 kW nameplate capacity), Users have up to one year from the generation end date to upload generation. For large Generators (\>150 kW nameplate capacity), Users have 62-days from the generation end date to upload generation. M-RETS must approve any generation outside of these ranges. Failure to adhere to these ranges may lead to delays in receiving Certificates.

For new Generators, M-RETS will accept generation within 62 days from the date of registration without supplemental documentation. However, M-RETS may accept generation which occurred between the 62-day deadline and two years prior to the current month with a completed Variance Request Form. Upon registration, the Organization must contact M-RETS (<systemadmin@mrets.org>) in writing and ask that M-RETS grant a variance. M-RETS shall review all issuance requests made outside of the 62-day window and may grant a variance if they determine that the request is made in good faith and: that the Organization submitted their request for a variance in writing at the time of Generator registration, that there is a legitimate reason to issue the Certificates, and that there is no likelihood Certificates were previously claimed or retired. M-RETS may submit the variance request---or send an email outlining the circumstances---to a state or provincial regulator should there be concern compliance with the variance request could result in potential double counting.

### Section 4.4.3: Requirements of Data Reporting Entities (QREs)

M-RETS will accept generation data from Control Area Operators, Qualified Reporting Entities and Self-Reporting Generators.

M-RETS maintains an agreement with each of these reporting entities, known as the Reporting Entity Terms of Use, that describes the terms and conditions under which the reporting entity agrees to exchange information and conduct business with M-RETS. M-RETS will maintain a list in each QRE's Organization of the Generating Units for which the QRE is reporting. M-RETS will outline the protocols for collection of information such as meter IDs, data format, communication protocols and timing, and security requirements for data collection in the Interface Control Document. M-RETS will update this document when any changes are made that may impact the data collection process. To minimize the impact of document changes, this document is a general template that outlines a common approach and set of standards. The Reporting Entity Terms of Use contain the specific data collection parameters for each reporting entity. M-RETS will work with the personnel from the QREs to verify information and address specific requirements of each reporting entity.

M-RETS reserves the right to audit the MWh data totals submitted at any time.

### Section 4.4.4: Measurement of Generation and Adjustments

M-RETS will measure the output from each Generating Unit delivered into either the transmission or distribution grid. Certificates do not reflect nor does M-RETS measure losses occurring on the bulk transmission or distribution systems after the metering. M-RETS will not create Certificates for that portion of the generation used to supply station service. Therefore, generation data supplied to M-RETS must not reflect station service supplied from the Generator's side of the point of interconnection. For wholesale Generators also serving on-site loads, M-RETS will create Certificates for the on-site load distinct from station service, if the Generator Owner can provide evidence that the metering used is capable of distinguishing between on-site load and station service. Otherwise, M-RETS will assume a conservative default fraction of total generation is station service unless it can be proved otherwise.

If, due to metering, reporting, error or any other reason, the data requires an adjustment, the reporting entity must report the adjustment as soon as possible to M-RETS.

### Section 4.4.5: Changes to Issuances (Rollbacks and Prior Period Adjustments)

The User must notify M-RETS if they believe the generation data amount recorded on the Generation Log is inaccurate for any reason. This is known as registering a dispute. Adjustments made after the upload of generation data to M-RETS and/or Certificate issuance are known as Rollbacks or Prior Period Adjustments.

If the QRE or User uploaded incorrect generation data and the Certificates remain in the issuance Account, M-RETS will Rollback the issuance. Once the Rollback is complete, the Certificates may be re-uploaded.

If the QRE or User uploaded incorrect generation data and the Certificates do not remain in the issuance Account, a Prior Period Adjustment is required. M-RETS will post the Prior Period Adjustment to the Generation Log associated with the Generating Unit. This will have the effect of applying a credit or debit to the generation amount reported in the current month. Consequently, the adjustment occurs upon the next Certificate issuance. If new Certificates are created, the month of creation of the Certificates shall be the same as all other Certificates created that month, however the Certificates will also indicate the month the prior period generation occurred.

If a User requests a Rollback outside of the acceptable upload range, M-RETS may require evidence of data inaccuracy. This includes, but is not limited to:

a.  Screenshot(s) of internal readings

b.  Official readouts of generation

All requests for Rollbacks and Prior Period Adjustments are subject to review by M-RETS.

### Section 4.4.6: Data Transmittal

Users must electronically transfer data files to M-RETS using a secured protocol and a standard format specified by M-RETS. The data shall reflect, at a minimum, the month and year of the generation, monthly accumulated MWhs for each meter ID and the associated meter ID(s) for each resource.

The data must be transmitted by a single entity, which must be either (1) the Control Area Operator, or (2) a QRE, or (3) a Self-Reporting Generator.

Section 4.5: Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs)
-------------------------------------------------

### Section 4.5.1: Creation of Certificates

Small Generators (1 to 150 kW) have up to one year from the generation
end date to upload generation. Large Generators (\>150 kW) have 62 days
from the generation end date to upload generation. This applies
regardless of whether the Generator is self-reporting or uses a QRE.
M-RETS must approve any generation outside of these ranges.

All generation data submitted to M-RETS will undergo an automatic
validation process. The process includes an automated verification
process that reviews the feasibility of the generation amount, ensures
there are no overlapping generation entries, and that there are no
lapses in generation information.

M-RETS only issues Certificates in whole numbers. A Certificate created
and tracked within M-RETS represents all renewable attributes from one
MWh of renewable generation. M-RETS Certificates are "Whole
Certificates," meaning that none of the renewable attributes may be
split off from the Certificate while it is in circulation in M-RETS.

Depending on User settings, the System will notify the User via email
that generation has been posted. The generation posting will be marked
"Issued" on the Generation Log.

Certificates in M-RETS do not have a specific expiration date. States
and Provinces define the lifetime or expiration date for Certificates as
applied to the programs they oversee.

M-RETS will issue one electronic Certificate for each MWh of energy
generated by those Generating Units registered with M-RETS. Certificates
will be issued based on the number of whole MWhs on the Generation Log
on the day of Certificate creation. M-RETS will issue Certificates no
more frequently than once per month per Generating Unit.

### Section 4.5.2: Data Fields Carried on Each Certificate

a.  Serial Number(s)

b.  Account

c.  ID

d.  Generator Fuel Type

e.  Vintage Date

f.  Location

g.  Quantity

h.  Eligibilities

### Section 4.5.3: Retirement of Certificates

Certificate Retirement is an action taken by the User to remove a
Certificate from circulation. M-RETS is not responsible for ensuring
that Users Retire Certificates for voluntary or compliance purposes.
M-RETS requires all Users to initiate and complete all retirements.
M-RETS maintains an integrated online help guide that Users can access
[here](https://help.mrets.org/en/).

M-RETS has a pull-down menu of options for acceptable retirement reasons
that the Organization must select to complete the retirement. The
options will be consistent with regulatory programs and any voluntary
programs or voluntary market activities. Users shall notify M-RETS if
they would like to add a new type of voluntary or compliance retirement
reason.

### 

### Section 4.5.4: Retirement Types

#### Beneficial Ownership (BBO)

-   Formal Definition: With respect to any Credit, Beneficial Ownership
    > Rights means any contractual or other right to direct or control
    > the sale or other disposition of, or the Retirement of, such
    > Credit or (ii) any contractual or other right to receive the
    > benefits of such Credit or any proceeds from the sale or other
    > disposition of such Credit.

-   M-RETS Uses: All retirements for the benefit of an individual owner
    > for a general environmental reason (i.e. company purchasing RECs
