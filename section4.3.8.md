### Section 4.3.8: Changes to Static Data

In addition to the annual update, Users must notify M-RETS of the following that have the effect of changing static data tracked by M-RETS within 30 calendar days of the effective date and/or knowledge of the change:

1. A change in fuel type at a Generating Unit, and the date on which the change occurred.
2. A change in Generating Unit ownership (_See_Section 4.3.12: Changing the Organization to which the Generator is Associated).
3. A change to Generator eligibility for any programs or certification tracked by M-RETS. Before M-RETS adds an eligibility to a Generator, M-RETS will verify the Generator meets the states eligibility requirements. In the case where a state requires preapproval, M-RETS will require the appropriate documentation and reserves the right to verify this information with the appropriate state, province or independent certifier. A User may remove an eligibility at any time.
4. A change to any of the &quot;essential generating characteristics&quot;.

M-RETS can remove Generators for cause, including willful misrepresentation of static data. M-RETS may rely on the M-RETS dispute resolution process (_See_[M-RETS Terms of Use](https://help.mrets.org/en/articles/1376725-terms-of-use)) to address such situations, and M-RETS will accept no liability for Generator misrepresentations. M-RETS reserves the right to take appropriate action in consultation with the M-RETS Board to respond to willful misrepresentation of static data, including but not limited to withholding issuing Certificates, Inactivating an Organization associated with a particular Generating Unit, or withholding participation in M-RETS for Generating Units that have willfully misrepresented static data.
