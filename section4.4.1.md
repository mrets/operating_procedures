### Section 4.4.1: Acceptable Format

A QRE or User must upload generation through the M-RETS portal. The data must be in a .csv file format. Excel or Notepad can create a CSV file. Programs (e.g. Microsoft Excel) that add formatting may reformat date fields which will result in errors when loading the file. The data shall be in ASCII Text with data fields delimited by commas (Comma-Separated Value – CSV format). M-RETS supports two types of reporting. Users may upload all their generation for the whole month or in partial months as long as a whole month is uploaded.

- Uploading by hour or minute is optional.
- RECs are still created, retired, and transferred in MWH. Generation by hour or minute provide more granularity in the data associated with each REC batch.
- While generation by hour or minute increments is uploaded in kWh, Certificates are still only created in MWh.
